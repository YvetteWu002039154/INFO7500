# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx npx hardhat coverage
```

- ## Requirements:
  1. Complete Solidity contract files
  2. Comprehensive tests that give 100% line and 100% branch coverage
  3. HTML Coverage Report

## File Structure

- **Contracts:**

  - `HW4/contracts/AMM.sol` - Automated Market Maker contract
  - `HW4/contracts/MockERC20.sol` - Mock ERC20 token contract

- **Tests:**

  - `HW4/test/AMM.test.js` - Comprehensive tests for AMM contract

- **Coverage Report:**

  - `HW4/coverage/index.html` - HTML coverage report
  - `HW4/coverage.json` - Coverage data
